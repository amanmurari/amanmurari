Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Aman Murari Singh, and I am a data scientist with a passion for using data to tell compelling stories and drive informed decision-making.

On this profile, you'll find examples of my work in data science, including projects I've worked on, code I've written, and insights I've uncovered. My areas of expertise include data visualization, machine learning, and statistical modeling. I'm also interested in using data to explore social and environmental issues.

I'm always looking to collaborate with others who share my passion for data science. Let's connect and see how we can work together to uncover valuable insights from data!

You can also find me on LinkedIn, where I regularly share articles and insights on data science and related topics.

Projects
========

Here are some examples of my projects:

1. **COVID-19 sentiment analysis**: I used natural language processing techniques to analyze Twitter data and create visualizations of public sentiment toward COVID-19 vaccines.
2. **MovieLens dataset analysis**: I used statistical modeling and data visualization to explore movielens.org, a dataset of movie ratings from a movie streaming platform.
3. **Soccer player comparison**: I used machine learning algorithms to compare soccer players based on their performance data.
4. **Predicting stock prices**: I used time series analysis and machine learning to predict stock prices for a hypothetical portfolio.
